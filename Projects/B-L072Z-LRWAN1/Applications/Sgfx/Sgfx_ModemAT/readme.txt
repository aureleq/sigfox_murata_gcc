@par Description

 This directory contains a set of source files that implements a simple modem  of 
 a Sigfox Object connecting to a Sigfox Network. The Sigfox modem run on
 B-L072Z-LRWAN1.
  ******************************************************************************

 ModemAT application shows how to eprform some basic operations like setting the
 RC zone, sending a frame, generate a continues wave, etc., by controlling the
 device from PC via an hyper terminal.
 Once the hyperterminal is connected, comand can be send, as for example:
   AT$ID?  gets the device ID
   AT$RCZ?  gets the RC zone configuration
   AT$RCZ=<value> sets the RC zone (1 for Europe, 2 for North America, 4 for South America)
   AT$SB=<value> sen a bit where value is 0 or 1
   AT$SF=<value> send a frame where value is a sequence of ASCII (e.g. 48454C4C4F to write HELLO)
   AT$CW=<value> generate a continues sinusoid at frequency <value>. <value>=0 to stop the generation.
   ATS300 send an out of band message
   ATS302=<value> set radio output power in dBm (range 5 to 20)
   ATS410=<value> set the crypto key 0: for private key, 1 for public key
   ATS400 this comand shall not be used on real Sigfox network, but just for certification purpose
  More details can be found by reading the user manual UM2245.pdf

@par Hardware and Software environment 


  - This example runs on STM32L072/82 embedded in the module
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    B-L072Z-LRWAN1 RevC boards 

  - Set Up:

             --------------------------  V    V  --------------------------
             |     B-L072Z-LRWAN1     |  |    |  |      Sigfox Netork     |
             |         with           |  |    |  |                        |

             --------------------------          --------------------------

  - Defining DEBUG in hw_conf.h allows keeping the debugger attached
    If DEBUG flag is not defined (hw_conf.h) the debugger disconnects in order to reduce power consumption

  - Depending on tool chain in order to connect the debugger again (when in low power) can be necessary 
    to keep the reset button pressed when starting the next download or
    to erase the chip memory. This to avoid the device to enter low power before debugger connection.
    It can also be necessary to reset the board after the download.

  - Defining TRACE in hw_conf.h allows to see the activity by connecting with an hyperterminal

  - In order to access Sigfox Network each device needs to be "Personalised" and "Activate".
    See ../SignatureGenerator/readme.txt
    Otherwise (for test purposes) a Sigfox Network Emulator can be used instead of real Sigfox Network 
    by using the AT command: ATS410=1

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files, erase the chip memory  and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Open 1 Terminal connected to the sigfox modem 
  - Terminal Config = 9600, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control ( in src/vcom.c)
  - JP9 must have pin 1 and 2 connected (TCXO_VCC managed by MCU) 
  - The solder bridge SB26 must be closed.(DIO4 from radio connected to PA5)
  - The solder bridge SB13 must be closed. (TCXO_OUT connected to PH0-OSC-IN)
